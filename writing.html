                Here I have compiled a collection of some samples of writings I
                have completed during my undergraduate engineering studies.
                I do not view these examples as "perfect"; however, I believe they do
                effectively convey my writing style.

                        answering the question: "What is an ethical engineer?"
                        by choosing and justifying characteristics I believe an
                        ethical engineer must embody.

                        For our final case study in our Engineering Ethics course (CPRE 232),
                        we were instructed to:
                        (1) Identify an ethics problem based in real-world engineering practise.
                        (2) Develop an ethics framework and analyze the ethical problem based on this framework.
                        (3) Identify possible solutions to this ethics problem.
