            <b>A:</b>
            I find beauty in things that are lightweight and work well.
            Modern webpages often contain too much unnecessary bloat (e.g., CSS and JS).
            This website works better without this bloat (it loads faster; is more maintainable).

            Plus, this website works pretty great on <a href="https://lynx.invisible-island.net/">Lynx</a>.
