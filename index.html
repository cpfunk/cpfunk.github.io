        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <p>
            I am currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in electrical engineering at Iowa State University.
            Before coming to Iowa State to study electrical engineering, I worked for 6 years as an automotive technician at
            Holmes Transmission and Auto Repair Inc. in Monticello Iowa.
        </p>
        <p>
            While working as a technician, I received my associate's degree in automotive technology from Kirkwood Community College in Cedar Rapids,
            Iowa and achieved ASE L1 - engine performance specialist and L3 - Light hybrid vehicle specialist certifications in addition to ASE master
            technician certification.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my electrical engineering studies, I am interested in specializing in VLSI and control systems design.
            In my free time, I enjoy reading, coding, and working on cars.
        </p>
