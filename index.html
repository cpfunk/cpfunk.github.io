        <h2>Welcome to Christopher's Website</h2>
        <p style="max-width: 800px;">
            I am currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in electrical engineering at Iowa State University.
            Before coming to Iowa State to study electrical engineering, I worked for 6 years as an automotive technician at
            Holmes Transmission and Auto Repair Inc. in Monticello Iowa.
            While working as a technician, I received my associate's degree in automotive technology from Kirkwood Community College in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. I achieved ASE L1 - engine performance specialist and L3 - Light hybrid vehicle specialist certifications in addition to ASE master technician certification. 
            In my electrical engineering studies, I am interested in specializing in VLSI and control systems design.
            In my free time, I enjoy reading, coding, and working on cars.
